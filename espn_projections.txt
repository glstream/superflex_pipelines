Jackson's dual-threat ability and the potential for more passing under new playcaller Todd Monken is enough to make him a midrange QB1 with elite upside.", "stats": [{"appliedAverage": 18.51, "appliedTotal": 222.12, "externalId": "2023", "id": "002023", "proTeamId": 0, "scoringPeriodId": 0, "seasonId": 2023, "statSourceId": 0, "statSplitTypeId": 0, "stats": {"0": 334.0, "1": 228.0, "2": 106.0, "3": 2618.0, "4": 13.0, "5": 518.0, "6": 255.0, "7": 125.0, "8": 99.0, "9": 47.0, "10": 20.0, "11": 41.0, "12": 18.0, "13": 16.0, "14": 4.0, "15": 1.0, "17": 1.0, "20": 5.0, "21": 0.68263473, "22": 218.16666667, "23": 112.0, "24": 574.0, "25": 5.0, "27": 110.0, "28": 52.0, "29": 23.0, "30": 18.0, "31": 6.0, "32": 1.0, "33": 17.0, "34": 5.0, "37": 1.0, "39": 5.125, "40": 47.83333333, "64": 29.0, "65": 7.0, "66": 4.0, "68": 11.0, "69": 4.0, "70": 2.0, "72": 6.0, "73": 11.0, "107": 1.0, "109": 1.0, "155": 9.0, "156": 3.0, "158": 108.0, "175": 5.0, "176": 6.0, "178": 1.0, "179": 3.0, "180": 2.0, "210": 12.0, "211": 113.0, "212": 36.0}}, {"appliedAverage": 21.919572010266666, "appliedTotal": 328.793580154, "externalId": "2023", "id": "102023", "proTeamId": 0, "scoringPeriodId": 0, "seasonId": 2023, "statSourceId": 1, "statSplitTypeId": 0, "stats": {"0": 460.8531262, "1": 289.8347439, "2": 171.0183822, "3": 3373.981019, "4": 24.86938922, "5": 674.0, "6": 337.0, "7": 168.0, "8": 134.0, "9": 67.0, "10": 33.0, "11": 57.0, "12": 28.0, "15": 2.599941627, "16": 1.699061853, "17": 2.284868491, "18": 0.308625823, "19": 1.429577876, "20": 11.69014147, "21": 0.628909141, "22": 224.9320679, "23": 142.1852585, "24": 920.0249721, "25": 5.152093749, "26": 0.196128538, "27": 184.0, "28": 92.0, "29": 46.0, "30": 36.0, "31": 18.0, "33": 28.0, "34": 14.0, "35": 0.283631035, "36": 0.198541724, "37": 2.475306199, "38": 0.084472704, "39": 6.470607302, "40": 61.33499814, "62": 1.625706413, "63": 0.040109386, "64": 36.42919408, "65": 7.088883351, "66": 2.02688628, "68": 9.115769631, "69": 3.402664009, "70": 0.932367689, "72": 4.335031697, "73": 16.02517317, "210": 15.0, "211": 161.6627586, "212": 45.37226713}}]}, "ratings": {"0": {"positionalRanking": 9, "totalRanking": 18, "totalRating": 222.12}}, "rosterLocked": false, "status": "WAIVERS", "tradeLocked": false, "waiverProcessDate": 1702281600000}, {"draftAuctionValue": 0, "id": 4040715, "keeperValue": 0, "keeperValueFuture": 0, "lineupLocked": false, "onTeamId": 0, "player": {"active": true, "defaultPositionId": 1, "draftRanksByRankType": {"STANDARD": {"auctionValue": 29, "published": false, "rank": 30, "rankSourceId": 0, "rankType": "STANDARD", "slotId": 0}, "PPR": {"auctionValue": 29, "published": false, "rank": 30, "rankSourceId": 0, "rankType": "PPR", "slotId": 0}}, "droppable": false, "eligibleSlots": [0, 7, 20, 21], "firstName": "Jalen", "fullName": "Jalen Hurts", "id": 4040715, "injured": false, "injuryStatus": "ACTIVE", "jersey": "1", "lastName": "Hurts", "lastNewsDate": 1701654417000, "lastVideoDate": 1701715515000, "outlooks": {"outlooksByWeek": {"1": "Hurts is coming off a Super Bowl run and while he didn't get his Eagles the win in the big game, he's projected to finish Week 1 with a top-five performance against a tough Patriots defense.

On the other end of the spectrum we have Philadelphia, a team likely without Nakobe Dean this week.", "3": "Hockenson caught 7-of-8 passes for 66 yards and two touchdowns in the Vikings' Week 2 loss versus the Eagles. He should see a similar amount of targets in Week 3 against the Chargers and is worth the start at tight end.", "4": "Hockenson caught eight of a season-high 11 targets in Week 3, accounting for 78 receiving yards in the Vikings 28-24 loss to the Chargers. Early on, Hockenson leads tight ends in targets per game and receptions per game. Week 4 should be another busy week with a road date in Carolina, setting up Hockenson to remain one of the best fantasy tight ends.", "5": "Hockenson was quiet in Week 4's win over the Panthers, catching just two passes for 24 yards and ending up with only 4.4 fantasy points. He had scored double-digit fantasy points in each of his first three games, including a stellar 25.6-point output against the Eagles in Week 2. He's got a decent matchup against the Chiefs on tap for Week 5, so we'll be looking for him to return to form. ", "6": "Hockenson caught 5-of-8 targets for 51 yards in the Vikings' Week 5 loss to Kansas City. Given WR Justin Jefferson's injury (hamstring), Kirk Cousins may look to utilize Hockenson even more in Week 6 versus the Bears. Fantasy managers should definitely lock in Hockenson for the start at tight end.", "7": "A pace for 102 catches is impressive. Less impressive is the pace for just 861 yards. It is hard to complain about solid tight end production given the state of the position, thus, Hockenson is still a solid starter even against San Francisco's stingy back seven.", "8": "His unique season continued last week, as Hockenson is pacing for a wild reception total and a modest yardage tally. Those in PPR formats won't complain, especially as a Packers defense lacking splash plays is up next. ", "9": "Hockenson continued his dominant play in Week 8 with eight receptions for 88 yards and a touchdown. With rookie QB Jaren Hall starting in Week 9, Hockenson should be busy serving as a safety valve. He projects as one of the best fantasy options on the slate facing a Falcons defense that has surrendered the sixth most points per game to tight ends. ", "10": "Third at the position in fantasy points per game amid a down year at tight end, Hockenson is an every-week starter without any doubt. The loss of his trusted quarterback is an issue, but he should be busy against the Saints this week.", "11": "It didn't take long for new Joshua Dobbs to get acquainted with Hockenson, as the tight end corralled 11 or 15 targets for 134 yards and a touchdown in Week 10. Hockenson is one of the few elite tight ends, with matchup-proof status. Look for another big effort in Week 11 on the road against the suspect Broncos defense.", "12": "Cutting his target volume way down to seven speaks more about how high it was than any alarm over last week's usage. The hope is that even if Justin Jefferson returns, softer coverage then awaits this talented pass-catcher for this matchup with a porous pass defense.", "14": "Hockenson had five catches for 50 yards and a touchdown against the Bears in Week 12, racking up 16 fantasy points. He's now scored double-digit fantasy points 10 times this season and even came through against Chicago on a day when QB Joshua Dobbs was struggling mightily. While we're still awaiting word on whether or not Dobbs still has the starting job, Hockenson has been too good this season to bench.

The 21-year-old will learn on the job this season and will be a potential breakout player in 2024.", "stats": [{"appliedAverage": 19.908333333333335, "appliedTotal": 238.9, "externalId": "2023", "id": "002023", "proTeamId": 0, "scoringPeriodId": 0, "seasonId": 2023, "statSourceId": 0, "statSplitTypeId": 0, "stats": {"0": 418.0, "1": 265.0, "2": 153.0, "3": 3540.0, "4": 20.0, "5": 703.0, "6": 349.0, "7": 172.0, "8": 135.0, "9": 64.0, "10": 29.0, "11": 50.0, "12": 22.0, "13": 27.0, "14": 11.0, "15": 4.0, "16": 3.0, "17": 5.0, "18": 1.0, "20": 5.0, "21": 0.63397129, "22": 295.0, "23": 35.0, "24": 143.0, "25": 3.0, "26": 1.0, "27": 25.0, "28": 11.0, "29": 3.0, "30": 1.0, "33": 2.0, "39": 4.08571429, "40": 11.91666667, "41": 1.0, "53": 1.0, "58": 1.0, "59": 1.0, "64": 31.0, "65": 5.0, "66": 2.0, "68": 7.0, "69": 3.0, "70": 1.0, "72": 4.0, "73": 9.0, "155": 7.0, "156": 5.0, "158": 140.0, "175": 9.0, "176": 4.0, "177": 3.0, "179": 3.0, "210": 12.0, "211": 161.0, "212": 16.0}}, {"appliedAverage": 12.654569382266667, "appliedTotal": 189.818540734, "externalId": "2023", "id": "102023", "proTeamId": 0, "scoringPeriodId": 0, "seasonId": 2023, "statSourceId": 1, "statSplitTypeId": 0, "stats": {"0": 502.3278003, "1": 306.4831792, "2": 195.8446212, "3": 3264.570646, "4": 17.13595441, "5": 652.0, "6": 326.0, "7": 163.0, "8": 130.0, "9": 65.0, "10": 32.0, "11": 61.0, "12": 30.0, "15": 2.448287738, "16": 1.599956037, "17": 2.045843167, "18": 0.276339769, "19": 0.987851843, "20": 13.65091369, "21": 0.610125856, "22": 217.6380431, "23": 42.62647653, "24": 149.4284711, "25": 1.380031625, "26": 0.054904121, "27": 29.0, "28": 14.0, "29": 7.0, "30": 5.0, "31": 2.0, "33": 8.0, "34": 4.0, "35": 0.080227895, "36": 0.056159527, "37": 0.064364632, "38": 0.002196518, "39": 3.505531849, "40": 9.961898073, "62": 1.042755964, "63": 0.034582125, "64": 40.91020547, "65": 7.287724947, "66": 0.571848864, "68": 7.859573811, "69": 3.498107975, "70": 0.263050477, "72": 3.761158452, "73": 17.41207215, "210": 15.0, "211": 160.1704294, "212": 10.49223691}}]}, "ratings": {"0": {"positionalRanking": 4, "totalRanking": 9, "totalRating": 238.9}}, "rosterLocked": false, "status": "WAIVERS", "tradeLocked": false, "waiverProcessDate": 1702281600000}, {"draftAuctionValue": 0, "id": 3121422, "keeperValue": 0, "keeperValueFuture": 0, "lineupLocked": false, "onTeamId": 0, "player": {"active": true, "defaultPositionId": 3, "draftRanksByRankType": {"STANDARD": {"auctionValue": 10, "published": false, "rank": 64, "rankSourceId": 0, "rankType": "STANDARD", "slotId": 0}, "PPR": {"auctionValue": 10, "published": false, "rank": 64, "rankSourceId": 0, "rankType": "PPR", "slotId": 0}}, "droppable": true, "eligibleSlots": [3, 4, 5, 23, 7, 20, 21], "firstName": "Terry", "fullName": "Terry McLaurin", "id": 3121422, "injured": false, "injuryStatus": "ACTIVE", "jersey": "17", "lastName": "McLaurin", "lastNewsDate": 1701665984000, "lastVideoDate": 1701732627000, "outlooks": {"outlooksByWeek": {"1": "McLaurin enters Week 1 questionable due to turf toe but is still expected to suit up when the Commanders entertain the Arizona.

Coming out of the bye, the Vikings should finally get Jusitn Jefferson back in Week 14 -- and Addison hasn't scored more than 10.9 fantasy points in any of his last four games.

Sanders' 15th-place fantasy finish matched a career high, but the receiving struggles limited him to a 54% snaps share and eight single-digit fantasy outings. Carolina has a rookie QB and the offensive line is a big step back from what Sanders enjoyed in Philly, but the 26-year-old will handle the bulk of the carries and likely goal line work. That will be enough to keep him in the RB2 discussion, especially in non-PPR formats.", "stats": [{"appliedAverage": 6.281818181818181, "appliedTotal": 69.1, "externalId": "2023", "id": "002023", "proTeamId": 0, "scoringPeriodId": 0, "seasonId": 2023, "statSourceId": 0, "statSplitTypeId": 0, "stats": {"23": 105.0, "24": 325.0, "25": 1.0, "27": 61.0, "28": 29.0, "29": 12.0, "30": 8.0, "31": 2.0, "33": 16.0, "34": 5.0, "39": 3.0952381, "40": 29.54545455, "41": 22.0, "42": 126.0, "47": 22.0, "48": 9.0, "49": 3.0, "50": 2.0, "53": 22.0, "54": 1.0, "58": 35.0, "59": 130.0, "60": 5.72727273, "61": 11.45454545, "66": 2.0, "68": 2.0, "70": 2.0, "72": 2.0, "73": 2.0, "155": 1.0, "156": 10.0, "158": 6.0, "179": 1.0, "210": 11.0, "212": 21.0, "213": 7.0}}, {"appliedAverage": 14.410914991571428, "appliedTotal": 201.75280988199998, "externalId": "2023", "id": "102023", "proTeamId": 0, "scoringPeriodId": 0, "seasonId": 2023, "statSourceId": 1, "statSplitTypeId": 0, "stats": {"23": 215.7716992, "24": 1011.645096, "25": 5.342841274, "26": 0.229890538, "27": 202.0, "28": 101.0, "29": 50.0, "30": 40.0, "31": 20.0, "33": 43.0, "34": 21.0, "35": 0.442377286, "36": 0.3096641, "37": 2.655199326, "38": 0.090611766, "39": 4.688497611, "40": 71.36085741, "42": 297.3966546, "43": 0.745954721, "44": 0.041034841, "45": 0.048288648, "46": 0.031556631, "47": 59.0, "48": 29.0, "49": 14.0, "50": 11.0, "51": 5.0, "53": 35.97907766, "54": 7.0, "55": 3.0, "56": 0.12408224, "57": 0.003837595, "58": 51.4047786, "60": 8.265822083, "61": 20.97818726, "62": 0.270925379, "63": 0.010521019, "66": 2.04940977, "67": 0.341730976, "68": 2.391140745, "70": 0.942728494, "71": 0.191369346, "72": 1.13409784, "73": 1.13409784, "210": 14.17647059, "212": 53.32242708, "213": 15.55717388}}]}, "ratings": {"0": {"positionalRanking": 47, "totalRanking": 225, "totalRating": 69.1}}, "rosterLocked": false, "status": "WAIVERS", "tradeLocked": false, "waiverProcessDate": 1702281600000}, {"draftAuctionValue": 0, "id": 3051926, "keeperValue": 0, "keeperValueFuture": 0, "lineupLocked": false, "onTeamId": 0, "player": {"active": true, "defaultPositionId": 2, "draftRanksByRankType": {"STANDARD": {"auctionValue": 3, "published": false, "rank": 103, "rankSourceId": 0, "rankType": "STANDARD", "slotId": 0}, "PPR": {"auctionValue": 3, "published": false, "rank": 103, "rankSourceId": 0, "rankType": "PPR", "slotId": 0}}, "droppable": true, "eligibleSlots": [2, 3, 23, 7, 20, 21], "firstName": "Gus", "fullName": "Gus Edwards", "id": 3051926, "injured": false, "injuryStatus": "ACTIVE", "jersey": "35", "lastName": "Edwards", "lastNewsDate": 1701061091000, "lastVideoDate": 1701966798000, "outlooks": {"outlooksByWeek": {"1": "The \"Gus Bus\" is ready to roll in a matchup with Houston.

Njoku could finish as high as second on this team in targets and, with Watson entering his first full season in Cleveland, the 27-year-old tight end is a fine, back-end TE1 option.", "stats": [{"appliedAverage": 9.491666666666667, "appliedTotal": 113.9, "externalId": "2023", "id": "002023", "proTeamId": 0, "scoringPeriodId": 0, "seasonId": 2023, "statSourceId": 0, "statSplitTypeId": 0, "stats": {"41": 53.0, "42": 509.0, "43": 2.0, "47": 96.0, "48": 44.0, "49": 19.0, "50": 14.0, "51": 5.0, "53": 53.0, "54": 5.0, "58": 84.0, "59": 387.0, "60": 9.60377358, "61": 42.41666667, "67": 1.0, "68": 1.0, "71": 1.0, "72": 1.0, "73": 1.0, "108": 1.0, "109": 1.0, "155": 7.0, "156": 5.0, "158": 12.0, "183": 1.0, "184": 1.0, "210": 12.0, "213": 23.0}}, {"appliedAverage": 9.945151347971429, "appliedTotal": 139.2321188716, "externalId": "2023", "id": "102023", "proTeamId": 0, "scoringPeriodId": 0, "seasonId": 2023, "statSourceId": 1, "statSplitTypeId": 0, "stats": {"23": 2.408106305, "24": 9.402510276, "25": 0.155293633, "26": 0.006226932, "27": 1.0, "35": 0.004422037, "36": 0.003095426, "37": 0.000160304, "38": 5.47056e-06, "39": 3.904524587, "40": 0.663247613, "42": 570.8839944, "43": 4.896555338, "44": 0.273048755, "45": 0.199373682, "46": 0.130290701, "47": 114.0, "48": 57.0, "49": 28.0, "50": 22.0, "51": 11.0, "53": 50.95664452, "54": 10.0, "55": 5.0, "56": 0.553845766, "57": 0.01712925, "58": 70.35043559, "60": 11.20332784, "61": 40.26982533, "62": 0.279275687, "63": 0.002526717, "66": 0.025913441, "67": 0.548340404, "68": 0.574253844, "70": 0.011920183, "71": 0.307070626, "72": 0.318990809, "73": 0.318990809, "210": 14.17647059, "212": 2.651540344, "213": 28.21000878}}]}, "ratings": {"0": {"positionalRanking": 11, "totalRanking": 116, "totalRating": 113.9}}, "rosterLocked": false, "status": "WAIVERS", "tradeLocked": false, "waiverProcessDate": 1702281600000}, {"draftAuctionValue": 0, "id": 4385690, "keeperValue": 0, "keeperValueFuture": 0, "lineupLocked": false, "onTeamId": 0, "player": {"active": true, "defaultPositionId": 4, "draftRanksByRankType": {"STANDARD": {"auctionValue": 3, "published": false, "rank": 111, "rankSourceId": 0, "rankType": "STANDARD", "slotId": 0}, "PPR": {"auctionValue": 3, "published": false, "rank": 111, "rankSourceId": 0, "rankType": "PPR", "slotId": 0}}, "droppable": true, "eligibleSlots": [25, 5, 6, 23, 7, 20, 21], "firstName": "Dalton", "fullName": "Dalton Kincaid", "id": 4385690, "injured": false, "injuryStatus": "ACTIVE", "jersey": "86", "lastName": "Kincaid", "lastNewsDate": 1701055144000, "lastVideoDate": 1701807311000, "outlooks": {"outlooksByWeek": {"1": "The Bills selected Kincaid in the first round of the 2023 draft, even moving up to get him so they clearly have bid plans for the rookie tight end.

His 18.9 fantasy PPG during the span was seventh best among wide receivers. A Week 13 quad injury ended Moore's season early and he never quite got on track in 2022, reportedly clashing with coaches along the way. Moore scored one TD, never cleared 64 yards or 14.0 fantasy points during 16 appearances and his 0.9 YPRR ranked dead last. Moore is a talented player, so while he's a bit of a lottery ticket, it's possible he'll break out with Deshaun Watson in Cleveland.

Led by Roquan Smith, Marlon Humphrey and Marcus Williams, the Baltimore D/ST should be a fantasy factor as usual, and it doesn't hurt that return man Devin Duvernay is one of six players with two-plus return TDs since 2020.", "stats": [{"appliedAverage": 10.833333333333334, "appliedTotal": 130.0, "externalId": "2023", "id": "002023", "proTeamId": 0, "scoringPeriodId": 0, "seasonId": 2023, "statSourceId": 0, "statSplitTypeId": 0, "stats": {"89": 0.0, "90": 3.0, "91": 2.0, "92": 2.0, "94": 1.0, "95": 11.0, "96": 8.0, "98": 1.0, "99": 47.0, "100": 94.0, "103": 1.0, "105": 1.0, "106": 11.0, "107": 252.0, "108": 519.0, "109": 771.0, "110": 253.0, "111": 150.0, "112": 43.0, "113": 68.0, "114": 153.0, "115": 276.0, "116": 14.0, "117": 3.0, "118": 24.0, "119": 7.0, "120": 179.0, "121": 1.0, "122": 4.0, "123": 0.0, "124": 0.0, "127": 3287.0, "128": 0.0, "129": 2.0, "130": 6.0, "131": 3.0, "132": 1.0, "133": 0.0, "134": 0.0, "135": 0.0, "136": 0.0, "155": 9.0, "156": 3.0, "187": 179.0, "188": 0.0, "189": 3.0, "190": 2.0, "191": 2.0, "192": 1.0, "193": 4.0, "194": 0.0, "195": 0.0, "210": 12.0}}, {"appliedAverage": 5.472899099117646, "appliedTotal": 93.03928468499997, "externalId": "2023", "id": "102023", "proTeamId": 0, "scoringPeriodId": 0, "seasonId": 2023, "statSourceId": 1, "statSplitTypeId": 0, "stats": {"89": 0.141907428, "90": 0.637308807, "91": 2.44726582, "92": 2.515245426, "93": 0.102654285, "94": 1.891516613, "95": 14.28131108, "96": 8.685275997, "97": 2.497609715, "98": 0.25404769, "99": 42.69708978, "100": 85.39417957, "101": 0.364630154, "102": 0.187824, "103": 1.208454118, "104": 0.683062495, "105": 2.546625052, "106": 13.63614405, "109": 1057.715103, "110": 352.0, "111": 211.0, "113": 82.76056616, "114": 769.8676923, "115": 334.2782609, "116": 76.0, "117": 30.0, "118": 33.0, "119": 13.0, "120": 380.5086457, "121": 2.464260722, "122": 3.917324803, "123": 3.084574628, "124": 1.589023293, "125": 0.203089073, "126": 22.38286151, "127": 5978.30981, "129": 0.348343246, "130": 3.228547154, "131": 3.474936279, "132": 4.095157179, "133": 3.169073917, "134": 1.784197111, "135": 0.696686491, "136": 0.203058624, "137": 351.6652829, "160": -380.5086457, "210": 17.0}}]}, "ratings": {"0": {"positionalRanking": 2, "totalRanking": 97, "totalRating": 130.0}}, "rosterLocked": false, "status": "WAIVERS", "tradeLocked": false, "waiverProcessDate": 1702281600000}, {"draftAuctionValue": 0, "id": -16030, "keeperValue": 0, "keeperValueFuture": 0, "lineupLocked": false, "onTeamId": 0, "player": {"active": true, "defaultPositionId": 16, "draftRanksByRankType": {"STANDARD": {"auctionValue": 1, "published": false, "rank": 181, "rankSourceId": 0, "rankType": "STANDARD", "slotId": 0}, "PPR": {"auctionValue": 1, "published": false, "rank": 181, "rankSourceId": 0, "rankType": "PPR", "slotId": 0}}, "droppable": true, "eligibleSlots": [16, 20, 21], "firstName": "Jaguars", "fullName": "Jaguars D/ST", "id": -16030, "injured": false, "lastName": "D/ST", "outlooks": {"outlooksByWeek": {"1": "Don't let the fact the Jaguars finished just 26th in sacks last season on defense get in the way of what could be a rewarding initial matchup against a raw rookie passer.", "2": "Last week afforded this defensive unit multiple opportunities to produce splash plays against a raw rookie passer.

It's yet to be seen how this overhauled group will look on the field, but the Atlanta D/ST also gets a boost from what looks like a very light schedule, as well as the presence of returner Cordarrelle Patterson (nine career return TDs).", "stats": [{"appliedAverage": 6.333333333333333, "appliedTotal": 76.0, "externalId": "2023", "id": "002023", "proTeamId": 0, "scoringPeriodId": 0, "seasonId": 2023, "statSourceId": 0, "statSplitTypeId": 0, "stats": {"89": 0.0, "90": 1.0, "91": 2.0, "92": 2.0, "94": 1.0, "95": 7.0, "96": 8.0, "98": 1.0, "99": 26.0, "100": 52.0, "103": 1.0, "105": 1.0, "106": 13.0, "107": 317.0, "108": 479.0, "109": 796.0, "110": 262.0, "111": 154.0, "112": 60.0, "113": 50.0, "114": 193.0, "115": 123.0, "116": 15.0, "117": 5.0, "118": 8.0, "119": 1.0, "120": 232.0, "121": 2.0, "122": 3.0, "123": 2.0, "124": 0.0, "127": 3791.0, "128": 0.0, "129": 1.0, "130": 3.0, "131": 3.0, "132": 4.0, "133": 1.0, "134": 0.0, "135": 0.0, "136": 0.0, "155": 6.0, "156": 6.0, "187": 232.0, "188": 0.0, "189": 1.0, "190": 2.0, "191": 2.0, "192": 2.0, "193": 3.0, "194": 2.0, "195": 0.0, "210": 12.0}}, {"appliedAverage": 5.79595667782353, "appliedTotal": 98.531263523, "externalId": "2023", "id": "102023", "proTeamId": 0, "scoringPeriodId": 0, "seasonId": 2023, "statSourceId": 1, "statSplitTypeId": 0, "stats": {"89": 0.179367937, "90": 0.807580758, "91": 2.924292429, "92": 2.788278828, "93": 0.102549212, "94": 1.874717922, "95": 13.40788541, "96": 8.84960966, "97": 2.510437426, "98": 0.258549803, "99": 41.36133734, "100": 82.72267468, "101": 0.35259695, "102": 0.187824, "103": 1.195157764, "104": 0.679560158, "105": 2.517688083, "106": 13.72332462, "109": 1038.109433, "110": 346.0, "111": 207.0, "113": 72.08499789, "114": 862.5467626, "115": 234.5454545, "116": 86.0, "117": 34.0, "118": 23.0, "119": 9.0, "120": 374.1483029, "121": 2.465246525, "122": 3.680868087, "123": 2.711771177, "124": 1.283628363, "125": 0.158965897, "126": 22.0087237, "127": 5915.215629, "129": 0.425, "130": 3.74, "131": 3.655, "132": 3.995, "133": 2.89, "134": 1.53, "135": 0.595, "136": 0.17, "137": 347.9538605, "160": -374.1483029, "210": 17.0}}]}, "ratings": {"0": {"positionalRanking": 13, "totalRanking": 202, "totalRating": 76.0}}, "rosterLocked": false, "status": "WAIVERS", "tradeLocked": false, "waiverProcessDate": 1702281600000}, {"draftAuctionValue": 0, "id": -16006, "keeperValue": 0, "keeperValueFuture": 0, "lineupLocked": false, "onTeamId": 0, "player": {"active": true, "defaultPositionId": 16, "draftRanksByRankType": {"STANDARD": {"auctionValue": 1, "published": false, "rank": 185, "rankSourceId": 0, "rankType": "STANDARD", "slotId": 0}, "PPR": {"auctionValue": 1, "published": false, "rank": 185, "rankSourceId": 0, "rankType": "PPR", "slotId": 0}}, "droppable": true, "eligibleSlots": [16, 20, 21], "firstName": "Cowboys", "fullName": "Cowboys D/ST", "id": -16006, "injured": false, "lastName": "D/ST", "outlooks": {"outlooksByWeek": {"1": "The Cowboys open the season on the road against the Giants and QB Daniel Jones.

Both of those rates are third best in the league. Gay has also been a fantasy star since entering the league in 2019.

The 26-year-old, who has a pair of top-20 fantasy campaigns on his resume, has a good shot to lead the Patriots' new-look, Bill O'Brien-led offense in targets this season.

Hall is recovering from a torn ACL, so Cook may start 2022 strong, but as Hall's role increases, the 28-year-old will be reduced to flex value (at best).", "stats": [{"appliedAverage": 3.0333333333333337, "appliedTotal": 36.400000000000006, "externalId": "2023", "id": "002023", "proTeamId": 0, "scoringPeriodId": 0, "seasonId": 2023, "statSourceId": 0, "statSplitTypeId": 0, "stats": {"23": 59.0, "24": 197.0, "27": 35.0, "28": 14.0, "29": 4.0, "30": 3.0, "33": 6.0, "34": 1.0, "39": 3.33898305, "40": 16.41666667, "41": 13.0, "42": 77.0, "47": 13.0, "48": 5.0, "49": 1.0, "50": 1.0, "53": 13.0, "58": 18.0, "59": 97.0, "60": 5.92307692, "61": 6.41666667, "66": 2.0, "68": 2.0, "70": 2.0, "72": 2.0, "73": 2.0, "155": 4.0, "156": 8.0, "210": 12.0, "212": 10.0, "213": 3.0}}, {"appliedAverage": 11.10470854, "appliedTotal": 155.46591956, "externalId": "2023", "id": "102023", "proTeamId": 0, "scoringPeriodId": 0, "seasonId": 2023, "statSourceId": 1, "statSplitTypeId": 0, "stats": {"23": 171.9177833, "24": 737.3337613, "25": 4.39310598, "26": 0.235938682, "27": 147.0, "28": 73.0, "29": 36.0, "30": 29.0, "31": 14.0, "33": 34.0, "34": 17.0, "35": 0.34598103, "36": 0.242186721, "37": 1.454425749, "38": 0.049633971, "39": 4.288874293, "40": 52.01109519, "42": 214.6175228, "43": 1.068586985, "44": 0.051311312, "45": 0.044226662, "46": 0.028902123, "47": 42.0, "48": 21.0, "49": 10.0, "50": 8.0, "51": 4.0, "53": 28.89899304, "54": 5.0, "55": 2.0, "56": 0.089534249, "57": 0.0027691, "58": 38.02073825, "60": 7.42647062, "61": 15.13899538, "62": 0.287249994, "63": 0.009411055, "66": 1.831076313, "67": 0.307799813, "68": 2.138876126, "70": 0.842295104, "71": 0.172367896, "72": 1.014662999, "73": 1.014662999, "210": 14.17647059, "212": 40.6879224, "213": 11.7925947}}]}, "ratings": {"0": {"positionalRanking": 64, "totalRanking": 316, "totalRating": 36.4}}, "rosterLocked": false, "status": "WAIVERS", "tradeLocked": false, "waiverProcessDate": 1702281600000}, {"draftAuctionValue": 0, "id": 3122976, "keeperValue": 0, "keeperValueFuture": 0, "lineupLocked": false, "onTeamId": 0, "player": {"active": true, "defaultPositionId": 2, "draftRanksByRankType": {"STANDARD": {"auctionValue": 0, "published": false, "rank": 300, "rankSourceId": 0, "rankType": "STANDARD", "slotId": 0}, "PPR": {"auctionValue": 0, "published": false, "rank": 300, "rankSourceId": 0, "rankType": "PPR", "slotId": 0}}, "droppable": true, "eligibleSlots": [2, 3, 23, 7, 20, 21], "firstName": "Jeff", "fullName": "Jeff Wilson Jr.", "id": 3122976, "injured": false, "injuryStatus": "ACTIVE", "jersey": "23", "lastName": "Wilson Jr.", "lastNewsDate": 1701734336000, "outlooks": {"outlooksByWeek": {"5": "Ready to return to action as early as this week, Wilson appears third in line for meaningful snaps from the Miami backfield.

The likes of Kenny Clark, Preston Smith, De'Vondre Campbell and Jaire Alexander supply Green Bay with playmakers on each level and set this unit up for another solid D/ST campaign.", "stats": [{"appliedAverage": 5.916666666666667, "appliedTotal": 71.0, "externalId": "2023", "id": "002023", "proTeamId": 0, "scoringPeriodId": 0, "seasonId": 2023, "statSourceId": 0, "statSplitTypeId": 0, "stats": {"89": 0.0, "90": 1.0, "91": 0.0, "92": 2.0, "94": 2.0, "95": 6.0, "96": 7.0, "97": 2.0, "99": 29.0, "100": 58.0, "103": 1.0, "104": 1.0, "105": 2.0, "106": 7.0, "107": 311.0, "108": 550.0, "109": 861.0, "110": 282.0, "111": 167.0, "112": 61.0, "113": 54.0, "114": 623.0, "115": 176.0, "116": 59.0, "117": 21.0, "118": 13.0, "119": 4.0, "120": 243.0, "121": 4.0, "122": 4.0, "123": 1.0, "124": 0.0, "127": 4080.0, "128": 0.0, "129": 1.0, "130": 2.0, "131": 5.0, "132": 1.0, "133": 2.0, "134": 1.0, "135": 0.0, "136": 0.0, "155": 6.0, "156": 6.0, "187": 243.0, "188": 0.0, "189": 1.0, "190": 0.0, "191": 2.0, "192": 4.0, "193": 4.0, "194": 1.0, "195": 0.0, "210": 12.0}}, {"appliedAverage": 6.428663303705882, "appliedTotal": 109.287276163, "externalId": "2023", "id": "102023", "proTeamId": 0, "scoringPeriodId": 0, "seasonId": 2023, "statSourceId": 1, "statSplitTypeId": 0, "stats": {"89": 0.216858429, "90": 0.977988994, "91": 3.40170085, "92": 3.061530765, "93": 0.102829823, "94": 1.869309007, "95": 12.70516287, "96": 8.575640863, "97": 2.550988931, "98": 0.266905169, "99": 39.72520136, "100": 79.45040272, "101": 0.326101073, "102": 0.23736, "103": 1.190451076, "104": 0.678857932, "105": 2.535599904, "106": 12.46753729, "109": 1059.628241, "110": 353.0, "111": 211.0, "113": 73.90429044, "114": 805.0878049, "115": 211.56, "116": 80.0, "117": 32.0, "118": 21.0, "119": 8.0, "120": 359.9730825, "121": 2.466233117, "122": 3.444222111, "123": 2.338669335, "124": 0.977988994, "125": 0.114807404, "126": 21.17488721, "127": 5763.055366, "129": 0.604134341, "130": 4.935181941, "131": 4.075779569, "132": 3.760948996, "133": 2.237849742, "134": 0.935982782, "135": 0.357375244, "136": 0.092747385, "137": 339.0032568, "160": -359.9730825, "210": 17.0}}]}, "ratings": {"0": {"positionalRanking": 17, "totalRanking": 216, "totalRating": 71.0}}, "rosterLocked": false, "status": "WAIVERS", "tradeLocked": false, "waiverProcessDate": 1702281600000}, {"draftAuctionValue": 0, "id": -16014, "keeperValue": 0, "keeperValueFuture": 0, "lineupLocked": false, "onTeamId": 0, "player": {"active": true, "defaultPositionId": 16, "draftRanksByRankType": {"STANDARD": {"auctionValue": 0, "published": false, "rank": 428, "rankSourceId": 0, "rankType": "STANDARD", "slotId": 0}, "PPR": {"auctionValue": 0, "published": false, "rank": 428, "rankSourceId": 0, "rankType": "PPR", "slotId": 0}}, "droppable": true, "eligibleSlots": [16, 20, 21], "firstName": "Rams", "fullName": "Rams D/ST", "id": -16014, "injured": false, "lastName": "D/ST", "outlooks": {"outlooksByWeek": {"1": "Aaron Donald can't be everywhere and the Seahawks should have their way against this rebuilding Rams unit.

2022 and has now finished two of the last three seasons as a top-5 scorer at the position.

Over the last three seasons, he has made 96 of 105 FG attempts, and that 91.4% conversion rate is fourth-best among kickers with 50-plus tries. Volume has also benefited Koo, as he ranked third in FG attempts last season and sits fourth since 2020.

fantasy scorer at the position since Stephen Gostkowski in 2015. In fact, if we include his third-place finish in 2020, Carlson has scored 23 more fantasy points than any other kicker over the last three seasons. The 2018 fifth-round pick's success has stemmed from a combination of heavy volume and great accuracy. Carlson has converted 107 of a league-high 115 field goal attempts over the last three seasons. That 93% hit rate is tops in the league during that span. He also made 35 of 36 extra point attempts last season. The 28-year-old is arguably the league's best kicker and an elite fantasy option.", "stats": [{"appliedAverage": 6.916666666666667, "appliedTotal": 83.0, "externalId": "2023", "id": "002023",

Reader, Sam Hubbard and Trey Hendrickson anchoring the unit, the Bengals' D/ST looks like a fine fantasy option.", "stats": [{"appliedAverage": 5.25, "appliedTotal": 63.0, "externalId": "2023", "id": "002023", "proTeamId": 0, "scoringPeriodId": 0, "seasonId": 2023, "statSourceId": 0, "statSplitTypeId": 0, "stats": {"89": 0.0, "90": 0.0, "91": 1.0, "92": 3.0, "94": 1.0, "95": 12.0, "96": 7.0, "99": 32.0, "100": 64.0, "102": 1.0, "103": 1.0, "105": 2.0, "106": 9.0, "107": 277.0, "108": 518.0, "109": 795.0, "110": 261.0, "111": 155.0, "112": 39.0, "113": 52.0, "114": 343.0, "115": 283.0, "116": 31.0, "117": 11.0, "118": 24.0, "119": 6.0, "120": 273.0, "121": 2.0, "122": 3.0, "123": 3.0, "124": 0.0, "127": 4658.0, "128": 0.0, "129": 0.0, "130": 2.0, "131": 1.0, "132": 3.0, "133": 4.0, "134": 1.0, "135": 1.0, "136": 0.0, "155": 6.0, "156": 6.0, "187": 273.0, "188": 0.0, "189": 0.0, "190": 1.0, "191": 3.0, "192": 2.0, "193": 3.0, "194": 3.0, "195": 0.0, "210": 12.0}}, {"appliedAverage": 6.027760608294119, "appliedTotal": 102.47193034100002, "externalId": "2023", "id": "102023", "proTeamId": 0, "scoringPeriodId": 0, "seasonId": 2023, "statSourceId": 1, "statSplitTypeId": 0, "stats": {"89": 0.207482993, "90": 0.93537415, "91": 3.282312925, "92": 2.993197279, "93": 0.107054035, "94": 1.928206935, "95": 13.73813022, "96": 8.930975832, "97": 2.52268818, "98": 0.250973337, "99": 41.80340756, "100": 83.60681512, "101": 0.178784, "102": 0.23736, "103": 1.224857028, "104": 0.703349907, "105": 2.45140497, "106": 14.10459025, "109": 1055.392072, "110": 351.0, "111": 211.0, "113": 79.21365277, "114": 677.99, "115": 211.56, "116": 67.0, "117": 27.0, "118": 21.0, "119": 8.0, "120": 363.9093897, "121": 2.465986395, "122": 3.503401361, "123": 2.431972789, "124": 1.054421769, "125": 0.12585034, "126": 21.40643469, "127": 5909.856387, "129": 0.425, "130": 3.74, "131": 3.655, "132": 3.995, "133": 2.89, "134": 1.53, "135": 0.595, "136": 0.17, "137": 347.638611, "160": -363.9093897, "210": 17.0}}]}, "ratings": {"0": {"positionalRanking": 25, "totalRanking": 246, "totalRating": 63.0}}, "rosterLocked": false, "status": "WAIVERS", "tradeLocked": false, "waiverProcessDate": 1702281600000}, {"draftAuctionValue": 0, "id": -16010, "keeperValue": 0, "keeperValueFuture": 0, "lineupLocked": false, "onTeamId": 0, "player": {"active": true, "defaultPositionId": 16, "draftRanksByRankType": {"STANDARD": {"auctionValue": 0, "published": false, "rank": 486, "rankSourceId": 0, "rankType": "STANDARD", "slotId": 0}, "PPR": {"auctionValue": 0, "published": false, "rank": 486, "rankSourceId": 0, "rankType": "PPR", "slotId": 0}}, "droppable": true, "eligibleSlots": [16, 20, 21], "firstName": "Titans", "fullName": "Titans D/ST", "id": -16010, "injured": false, "lastName": "D/ST", "outlooks": {"outlooksByWeek": {"1": "The Titans D/ST requires a very favorable matchup to be given fantasy consideration.

Hines has never finished a season with more than 89 carries, and that was unlikely to change with Cook and Damien Harris in the mix. However, he has been busy as a receiver throughout his career (he ranks no lower than eighth among RBs in targets, receptions and receiving yards since he was drafted in 2018), so an expanded role in that area seems likely once healthy.

appearances.

Davis-Price was busy as a rusher (albeit with weak efficiency) but not so much as a receiver during three seasons at LSU, and that carried over to the pros, albeit in a small sample. Davis-Price totaled 99 yards on his 34 carries (2.9 YPC) and was targeted only twice during his rookie campaign. Perhaps the 22-year-old will someday carve out a role of fantasy significance, but he'll open 2023 buried behind, at least, McCaffrey and Elijah Mitchell.

If Jones' struggles carry over from last season, Zappe will get some starts, but he's unlikely to find his way to fantasy relevance.", "stats": [{"appliedAverage": 5.076666666666667, "appliedTotal": 30.46, "externalId": "2023", "id": "002023", "proTeamId": 0, "scoringPeriodId": 0, "seasonId": 2023, "statSourceId": 0, "statSplitTypeId": 0, "stats": {"0": 92.0, "1": 51.0, "2": 41.0, "3": 539.0, "4": 3.0, "5": 106.0, "6": 52.0, "7": 25.0, "8": 19.0, "9": 8.0, "10": 3.0, "11": 6.0, "12": 2.0, "13": 6.0, "14": 1.0, "20": 3.0, "21": 0.55434783, "22": 89.83333333, "23": 7.0, "24": 29.0, "27": 5.0, "28": 2.0, "39": 4.14285714, "40": 4.83333333, "64": 9.0, "73": 3.0, "155": 1.0, "156": 5.0, "158": 18.0, "175": 1.0, "176": 1.0, "177": 1.0, "210": 6.0, "211": 22.0, "212": 3.0}}, {"appliedAverage": 6.70591372, "appliedTotal": 13.41182744, "externalId": "2023", "id": "102023", "proTeamId": 0, "scoringPeriodId": 0, "seasonId": 2023, "statSourceId": 1, "statSplitTypeId": 0, "stats": {"0": 34.37833747, "1": 22.35371411, "2": 12.02462336, "3": 227.7073007, "4": 1.196189755, "5": 45.0, "6": 22.0, "7": 11.0, "8": 9.0, "9": 4.0, "10": 2.0, "11": 4.0, "12": 2.0, "15": 0.17715054, "16": 0.115767878, "17": 0.158188165, "18": 0.021367073, "19": 0.065937418, "20": 0.821485542, "21": 0.650226734, "22": 113.8536504, "23": 3.591511756, "24": 11.21882216, "25": 0.108379127, "26": 0.004673704, "27": 2.0, "28": 1.0, "35": 0.006805285, "36": 0.0047637, "37": 0.005438326, "38": 0.000186, "39": 3.123704703, "40": 5.609411081, "62": 0.070611122, "63": 0.003555936, "64": 2.438513867, "65": 0.736337027, "66": 0.071830235, "68": 0.808167262, "69": 0.353441773, "70": 0.033041908, "72": 0.386483681, "73": 1.207969223, "210": 2.0, "211": 11.43772812, "212": 0.799681503}}]}, "ratings": {"0": {"positionalRanking": 43, "totalRanking": 337, "totalRating": 30.460001}}, "rosterLocked": false, "status": "WAIVERS", "tradeLocked": false, "waiverProcessDate": 1702281600000}, {"draftAuctionValue": 0, "id": 4427728, "keeperValue": 0, "keeperValueFuture": 0, "lineupLocked": false, "onTeamId": 0, "player": {"active": true, "defaultPositionId": 2, "draftRanksByRankType": {"STANDARD": {"auctionValue": 0, "published": false, "rank": 1428, "rankSourceId": 0, "rankType": "STANDARD", "slotId": 0}, "PPR": {"auctionValue": 0, "published": false, "rank": 1428, "rankSourceId": 0, "rankType": "PPR", "slotId": 0}}, "droppable": true, "eligibleSlots": [2, 3, 23, 7, 20, 21], "firstName": "Zonovan", "fullName": "Zonovan Knight", "id": 4427728, "injured": true, "injuryStatus": "INJURY_RESERVE", "jersey": "28", "lastName": "Knight", "lastNewsDate": 1697315580000, "outlooks": {"outlooksByWeek": {"4": "Knight had three rushes for 13 yards in the Lions' Week 3 win over Atlanta.

He's not worth drafting in season-long formats with Ja'Marr Chase, Tee Higgins and Tyler Boyd atop the depth chart in Cincinnati.", "stats": [{"appliedAverage": 1.2666666666666666, "appliedTotal": 7.6, "externalId": "2023", "id": "002023", "proTeamId": 0, "scoringPeriodId": 0, "seasonId": 2023, "statSourceId": 0, "statSplitTypeId": 0, "stats": {"41": 1.0, "42": 6.0, "47": 1.0, "53": 1.0, "58": 2.0, "59": 7.0, "60": 6.0, "61": 1.0, "102": 1.0, "105": 1.0, "115": 185.0, "118": 17.0, "119": 4.0, "155": 2.0, "156": 4.0, "158": 6.0, "210": 6.0, "213": 1.0}}, {"appliedAverage": 1.4813901822000004, "appliedTotal": 22.220852733000005, "externalId": "2023", "id": "102023", "proTeamId": 0, "scoringPeriodId": 0, "seasonId": 2023, "statSourceId": 1, "statSplitTypeId": 0, "stats": {"42": 90.27912618, "43": 0.703676014, "44": 0.034343803, "45": 0.159968589, "46": 0.104539473, "47": 18.0, "48": 9.0, "49": 4.0, "50": 3.0, "51": 1.0, "53": 7.565948153, "54": 1.0, "56": 0.040107742, "57": 0.001240446, "58": 11.73893134, "60": 11.93229511, "61": 5.971770992, "62": 0.034343803, "63": 0.000353705, "67": 0.080387462, "68": 0.080387462, "71": 0.045016979, "72": 0.045016979, "73": 0.045016979, "102": 0.23736, "115": 211.56, "118": 21.0, "119": 8.0, "210": 15.11764706, "213": 3.352107204}}]}, "ratings": {"0": {"positionalRanking": 163, "totalRanking": 471, "totalRating": 7.6}}, "rosterLocked": false, "status": "WAIVERS", "tradeLocked": false, "waiverProcessDate": 1702281600000}, {"draftAuctionValue": 0, "id": 4361426, "keeperValue": 0, "keeperValueFuture": 0, "lineupLocked": false, "onTeamId": 0, "player": {"active": true, "defaultPositionId": 3, "draftRanksByRankType": {"STANDARD": {"auctionValue": 0, "published": false, "rank": 1444, "rankSourceId": 0, "rankType": "STANDARD", "slotId": 0}, "PPR": {"auctionValue": 0, "published": false, "rank": 1444, "rankSourceId": 0, "rankType": "PPR", "slotId": 0}}, "droppable": true, "eligibleSlots": [25, 3, 4, 5, 23, 7, 20, 21], "firstName": "Justin", "fullName": "Justin Shorter", "id": 4361426, "injured": true, "injuryStatus": "INJURY_RESERVE", "jersey": "18", "lastName": "Shorter", "lastNewsDate": 1693433247000, "ownership": {"activityLevel": null, "auctionValueAverage": 0.0, "auctionValueAverageChange": 0.0, "averageDraftPosition": 169.9450892857143, "averageDraftPositionPercentChange": 0.006580655346624553, "date": 1702130737743, "leagueType": 0, "percentChange": -0.0004764735978815132, "percentOwned": 0.045676597077749036, "percentStarted": 0.004625478185088509}, "proTeamId": 2, "seasonOutlook": "Shorter was selected in the fifth round of April's draft.

Standalone value is unlikely in an offense likely to struggle, but Edmonds may find his way to insurance value in deeper formats.", "stats": [{"appliedAverage": 1.7625, "appliedTotal": 14.1, "externalId": "2023", "id": "002023", "proTeamId": 0, "scoringPeriodId": 0, "seasonId": 2023, "statSourceId": 0, "statSplitTypeId": 0, "stats": {"23": 21.0, "24": 55.0, "27": 9.0, "28": 2.0, "39": 2.61904762, "40": 6.875, "41": 6.0, "42": 26.0, "47": 5.0, "48": 2.0, "53": 6.0, "58": 8.0, "59": 54.0, "60": 4.33333333, "61": 3.25, "107": 2.0, "108": 2.0, "109": 4.0, "155": 4.0, "156": 4.0, "210": 8.0, "212": 5.0, "213": 1.0}}, {"appliedAverage": 4.822312791571429, "appliedTotal": 67.51237908200001, "externalId": "2023", "id": "102023", "proTeamId": 0, "scoringPeriodId": 0, "seasonId": 2023, "statSourceId": 1, "statSplitTypeId": 0, "stats": {"23": 57.60616142, "24": 258.6232442, "25": 1.389557865, "26": 0.059918192, "27": 51.0, "28": 25.0, "29": 12.0, "30": 10.0, "31": 5.0, "33": 11.0, "34": 5.0, "35": 0.10896615, "36": 0.076276305, "37": 0.171850949, "38": 0.005864614, "39": 4.489506639, "40": 18.24313341, "42": 123.4857133, "43": 0.801753024, "44": 0.044231403, "45": 0.040876355, "46": 0.026712698, "47": 24.0, "48": 12.0, "49": 6.0, "50": 4.0, "51": 2.0, "53": 16.39811576, "54": 3.0, "55": 1.0, "56": 0.050519389, "57": 0.001562455, "58": 22.5297558, "60": 7.530481861, "61": 8.710610481, "62": 0.104149595, "63": 0.002124183, "66": 0.375795311, "67": 0.10697354, "68": 0.482768851, "70": 0.172865843, "71": 0.059905182, "72": 0.232771025, "73": 0.232771025, "210": 14.17647059, "212": 15.34016234, "213": 6.321062097}}]}, "ratings": {"0": {"positionalRanking": 90, "totalRanking": 421, "totalRating": 14.1}}, "rosterLocked": false, "status": "WAIVERS", "tradeLocked": false, "waiverProcessDate": 1702281600000}, {"draftAuctionValue": 0, "id": 3115364, "keeperValue": 0, "keeperValueFuture": 0, "lineupLocked": false, "onTeamId": 0, "player": {"active": true, "defaultPositionId": 2, "draftRanksByRankType": {"STANDARD": {"auctionValue": 0, "published": false, "rank": 1721, "rankSourceId": 0, "rankType": "STANDARD", "slotId": 0}, "PPR": {"auctionValue": 0, "published": false, "rank": 1721, "rankSourceId": 0, "rankType": "PPR", "slotId": 0}}, "droppable": true, "eligibleSlots": [2, 3, 23, 7, 20, 21], "firstName": "Leonard", "fullName": "Leonard Fournette", "id": 3115364, "injured": false, "injuryStatus": "ACTIVE", "jersey": "7", "lastName": "Fournette", "lastNewsDate": 1698689466000, "lastVideoDate": 1541349569000, "ownership": {"activityLevel": null, "auctionValueAverage": 0.0, "auctionValueAverageChange": 0.0, "averageDraftPosition": 169.89642857142857, "averageDraftPositionPercentChange": -0.006055290485534215, "date": 1702130717493, "leagueType": 0, "percentChange": -1.0078442352114747, "percentOwned": 2.6466134270781807, "percentStarted": 0.05650551993225645}, "proTeamId": 0, "rankings": {}, "seasonOutlook": "Fournette was released by the Buccaneers after three seasons as their lead back.

The 24-year-old is an interesting post-hype breakout candidate, but he'll need more of a receiving role in order to be anything more than a low-ceiling RB2/flex.", "stats": [{"appliedAverage": 11.7, "appliedTotal": 11.7, "externalId": "2023", "id": "002023", "proTeamId": 0, "scoringPeriodId": 0, "seasonId": 2023, "statSourceId": 0, "statSplitTypeId": 0, "stats": {"23": 8.0, "24": 22.0, "25": 1.0, "27": 4.0, "28": 2.0, "29": 1.0, "33": 1.0, "39": 2.75, "40": 22.0, "41": 2.0, "42": 15.0, "47": 3.0, "48": 1.0, "53": 2.0, "58": 3.0, "59": 15.0, "60": 7.5, "61": 15.0, "155": 1.0, "158": 6.0, "179": 1.0, "210": 1.0, "212": 1.0}}, {"appliedAverage": 14.142413176307693, "appliedTotal": 183.851371292, "externalId": "2023", "id": "102023", "proTeamId": 0, "scoringPeriodId": 0, "seasonId": 2023, "statSourceId": 1, "statSplitTypeId": 0, "stats": {"23": 180.8476097, "24": 873.980776, "25": 6.990447673, "26": 0.266316396, "27": 174.0, "28": 87.0, "29": 43.0, "30": 34.0, "31": 17.0, "33": 36.0, "34": 18.0, "35": 0.364454246, "36": 0.255117972, "37": 1.984946915, "38": 0.067738623, "39": 4.832691887, "40": 66.03410308, "42": 194.1169524, "43": 1.33947429, "44": 0.07709572, "45": 0.041200688, "46": 0.026924649, "47": 38.0, "48": 19.0, "49": 9.0, "50": 7.0, "51": 3.0, "53": 27.6056841, "54": 5.0, "55": 2.0, "56": 0.072558743, "57": 0.002244085, "58": 35.57268292, "60": 7.03177475, "61": 14.66661418, "62": 0.343412116, "63": 0.00588417, "66": 1.16020977, "67": 0.177101508, "68": 1.337311278, "70": 0.533696494, "71": 0.099176844, "72": 0.632873339, "73": 0.632873339, "210": 13.23529412, "212": 47.78069098, "213": 11.04325166}}]}, "ratings": {"0": {"positionalRanking": 98, "totalRanking": 439, "totalRating": 11.7}}, "rosterLocked": false, "status": "WAIVERS", "tradeLocked": false, "waiverProcessDate": 1702281600000}, {"draftAuctionValue": 0, "id": 4240380, "keeperValue": 0, "keeperValueFuture": 0, "lineupLocked": false, "onTeamId": 0, "player": {"active": true, "defaultPositionId": 3, "draftRanksByRankType": {"STANDARD": {"auctionValue": 0, "published": false, "rank": 1782, "rankSourceId": 0, "rankType": "STANDARD", "slotId": 0}, "PPR": {"auctionValue": 0, "published": false, "rank": 1782, "rankSourceId": 0, "rankType": "PPR", "slotId": 0}}, "droppable": true, "eligibleSlots": [3, 4, 5, 23, 7, 20, 21], "firstName": "KJ", "fullName": "KJ Hamler", "id": 4240380, "injured": false, "injuryStatus": "ACTIVE", "jersey": "1", "lastName": "Hamler", "lastNewsDate": 1696097810000, "ownership": {"activityLevel": null, "auctionValueAverage": 0.0, "auctionValueAverageChange": 0.0, "averageDraftPosition": 169.94642857142858, "averageDraftPositionPercentChange": 0.006420151557676945, "date": 1702130731879, "leagueType": 0, "percentChange": 0.0004840912833898349, "percentOwned": 0.0108280515919864, "percentStarted": 0.002312787718676707}, "proTeamId": 0, "stats": [{"appliedAverage": 0.0, "appliedTotal": 0.0, "externalId": "2023", "id": "002023", "proTeamId": 0, "scoringPeriodId": 0, "seasonId": 2023, "statSourceId": 0, "statSplitTypeId": 0, "stats": {}}, {"appliedAverage": 0.0, "appliedTotal": 0.0, "externalId": "2023", "id": "102023", "proTeamId": 0, "scoringPeriodId": 0, "seasonId": 2023, "statSourceId": 1, "statSplitTypeId": 0, "stats": {}}]}, "ratings": {"0": {"positionalRanking": 0, "totalRanking": 0, "totalRating": 0.0}}, "rosterLocked": false, "status": "WAIVERS", "tradeLocked": false, "waiverProcessDate": 1702281600000}, {"draftAuctionValue": 0, "id": 4046692, "keeperValue": 0, "keeperValueFuture": 0, "lineupLocked": false, "onTeamId": 0, "player": {"active": true, "defaultPositionId": 3, "draftRanksByRankType": {"STANDARD": {"auctionValue": 0, "published": false, "rank": 1783, "rankSourceId": 0, "rankType": "STANDARD", "slotId": 0}, "PPR": {"auctionValue": 0, "published": false, "rank": 1783, "rankSourceId": 0, "rankType": "PPR", "slotId": 0}}, "droppable": true, "eligibleSlots": [3, 4, 5, 23, 7, 20, 21], "firstName": "Chase", "fullName": "Chase Claypool", "id": 4046692, "injured": false, "injuryStatus": "ACTIVE", "jersey": "83", "lastName": "Claypool", "lastNewsDate": 1701469973000, "outlooks": {"outlooksByWeek": {"1": "Claypool is expected to be ready for Week 1 as the Bears starting slot receiver.

He was solid again in 2021 (989 yards and eight TDs on 195 touches) prior to tearing his Achilles in Week 16. He started off the 2022 season with a bang (four TDs and three top-12 fantasy outings during Weeks 1-3), but his role was then reduced and he was later traded to the Jets, where he appeared in four games and was often a healthy scratch. The 25-year-old may eventually get back to his early-career self, but fantasy relevance seems like a longshot.", "stats": [{"appliedAverage": 1.0, "appliedTotal": 1.0, "externalId": "2023", "id":

He is hoping to retain the starting job, as well as maybe welcoming back top target Justin Jefferson. There's an outside chance Nick Mullens is named the starter over Dobbs for this game, but Dobbs averaged 22.3 fantasy points in three games before that Bears disaster when he scored just 4.5 fantasy points. He's a borderline QB1 if he gets the start on Sunday."}}, "ownership": {"activityLevel": null, "auctionValueAverage": 0.4411764705882353, "auctionValueAverageChange": 0.07224443175328382,

Spiller's forced missed tackle and YAC profile was very good during his collegiate run and his elusiveness really stood out in 2021 (class-best 5.0 evaded tackle rate). Spiller's early-career struggles are a concern, but he's extremely young (entering his age-22 season) and will get another shot to unseat Joshua Kelley as the high-scoring Chargers' \"big\" back complement to Austin Ekeler.
